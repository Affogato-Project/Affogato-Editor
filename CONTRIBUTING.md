# Contribution Guidelines

At the moment, this project is not exactly open to code-related contributions. However, there are many ways you can still contribute to its progress, even in the way of code.

# Technical Contributions

# Financial Contributions

You can contribute any amount you're comfortable with through [PayPal](paypal.me/obsidianxvi) or [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/obsidianxvi).

> [!TIP]
> All the money in the buy-me-a-coffee account goes right into purchasing my favourite coffees — straight blacks, mochas, sometimes caramel frappés if I'm feeling down. So I would honestly prefer if you contributed to my spiritual well-being through that platform — all my best ideas have occurred to me while that rich octane pumps through my veins, and the code I write is mostly bug-free because of the zen mode it provides.

# Thank you!

If you've contributed in any of the above mentioned ways, then I just want to say: thank you so much, because it really means a lot to me that someone is willing to put in time/effort/money to help drive this project further. When I get stuck on a certain bug or when deadlines start to suffocate me, your interest in the project serves as motivation for me to push through.

And even if you haven't contributed, I'm still extremely grateful that you're checking it out anyways. I hope that you've been inspired to go and build out your own big ideas too, creating software with not just a purpose, but also a passion.
